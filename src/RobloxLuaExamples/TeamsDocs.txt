Teams
Show deprecated  
Service
This class is a Service! It is a top-level singleton which can be retrieved using the GetService function.

NotCreatable
This object cannot be created with the Instance.new constructor function.

The Teams service holds a game’s Team objects. Team objects must be parented to the Teams service.

Teams offer a range of features that are useful to developers. These can broadly be divided into features that work out-of-the-box and features developers can program into their game.

Built-in team behaviour
The following functionality of Teams exists by default and does not require the developer to program any custom behaviour.

When part of a Team, the name above a Player's character Model will be colored to the Team.TeamColor
Changing Player.TeamColor will cause Player.Team switch to the Team with the corresponding Team.TeamColor
When using the default player list users will be grouped and displayed by team
Setting Player.Neutral to true will cause the Player to be dis-associated with the team, but will not change Player.Team or Player.TeamColor
When a Player joins a game, they will be allocated to the team with Team.AutoAssignable set to true that has the fewest players. If no auto assignable team is available, Player.Neutral will be set to true
When SpawnLocation.Neutral is set to false, only players whose Player.TeamColor matches SpawnLocation.TeamColor can spawn on that SpawnLocation
When SpawnLocation.AllowTeamChangeOnTouch is set to true, a Player's Player.TeamColor will change to SpawnLocation.TeamColor when their character touches the SpawnLocation
Optional extended team behavior
Many developers chose to add the following features to teams in their own code.

Implement checks for team in weapon code to prevent team killing
Implement doors or other features that only certain teams can use
Periodically reassign teams to maintain team balance

The Team class represents a faction in a Roblox place. The only valid parent for a Team is in the Teams service. Teams offer a range of features that are useful to developers that can be divided into two rough groups:

Features that work ‘out of the box’
Features developers can program into their game.
**Built-in Team Behavior **

The following functionality of Teams exists by default and does not require the developer to program any custom behavior.

When part of a Team, the name above a Player's character Model will be colored to the Team.TeamColor
Changing Player.TeamColor will cause Player.Team to switch to the Team with the corresponding Team.TeamColor
When using the default player list users will be grouped and displayed together as a team
Setting Player.Neutral to true will cause the Player to be disassociated with the team, however, it will not change Player.Team or Player.TeamColor
When a Player joins a game, they will be allocated to the team with Team.AutoAssignable set to true that has the fewest players. If no auto assignable team is available, Player.Neutral will be set to true
When SpawnLocation.Neutral is set to false, only players whose Player.TeamColor matches SpawnLocation.TeamColor can spawn on that SpawnLocation
When SpawnLocation.AllowTeamChangeOnTouch is set to true, a Player's Player.TeamColor will change to SpawnLocation.TeamColor when their character touches the SpawnLocation
Optional Extended Team Behaviors

Many developers chose to add the following features to teams in their own code.

Implement checks in weapon code to prevent friendly fire.
Implement checks in doors or other features that allow only certain teams to use them
Periodically reassign teams to maintain team balance
Properties
bool 
AutoAssignable
This property determines whether Players will be automatically placed onto the Team when joining. If multiple teams have this property set to true, Roblox will attempt to even the teams out when Players are added.

BrickColor 
TeamColor
This property sets the color of the Team. Determines the Player.TeamColor property of players who are a member of the team. Also determines the color displayed on the player list and above player’s heads.

Functions
Objects 
GetPlayers ( )
Returns a list of Players who are assigned to the Team. A Player is considered assigned if their Player.Team property is equal to the Team and Player.Neutral is false.

Events
RBXScriptSignal 
PlayerAdded ( Instance player )
Fires whenever a Player is assigned to the Team. A player is considered assigned if their Player.Team property is equal to the Team and Player.Neutral is false.

RBXScriptSignal 
PlayerRemoved ( Instance player )
Fires whenever a Player is removed from a Team. This can be due to the Player leaving the game, Player.Neutral being set to true or the Player joining a different team.
