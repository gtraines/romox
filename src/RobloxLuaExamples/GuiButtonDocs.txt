GuiLabel is an abstract class that inherits from GuiObject. It is the base class for ImageButton and TextButton. Objects of this type serve to be interactive, clickable user interface elements. It defines several properties for interaction behavior, namely GuiButton.AutoButtonColor and GuiButton.Modal, as well as a handful of events for mouse buttons (GuiButton.MouseButton1Click, GuiButton.MouseButton1Down, etc).

The most import ant event of a GuiButton is GuiButton.Activated, a multi-platform event that fires when the button is activated. When using a mouse, this means clicking the button and releasing with the cursor still over the UI object. For touch, the same applies but with a touch instead of button press. Finally, for gamepads, GuiButton.Activated fires if a GuiButton is selected when the A-button is pressed and released. In short, this event is very useful for multi-platform user interface programming as it provides a nice general interface for a single user input.
