BillboardGui
Show deprecated  
BillboardGuis are containers for GUI objects that appear in the 3D space. A BillboardGui’s position is determined by the position of it’s BillboardGui.Adornee. If the adornee is set to Part then the BasePart.Position will be used. If it is set to Attachment then the Attachment.WorldPosition will be used. BillboardGui always faces the camera, and can change its size with distance or remain the same size on the screen. Unlike the text that appears above models with Humanoids’ heads, this does not disappear with distance.
